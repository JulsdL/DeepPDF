       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts\\nand consultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry\\npractices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user\\ndata, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance\\non the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based\\ndecision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of\\ntechnical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process.\\nUnder our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with\\nour systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.\\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the\\naudit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for\\nensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement\\nprocesses and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy committee of our board of directors (Privacy\\nCommittee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive privacy program. Management is\\nresponsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential', metadata={'source': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf', 'page': 51, 'total_pages': 147, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001326801-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-02 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001326801-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240202060356-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240202060413-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '591aa54a87154d7e9184a79ebb219377', '_collection_name': 'Meta 10-k Fillings 2'}),\n",
